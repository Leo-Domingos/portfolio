game,Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper,11190,0,False,,,"<h1>Buzz</h1><p><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1949030"" target=""_blank"" rel=""""  id=""dynamiclink_0"" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/1949030</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Recognized as one of the best licenses in adventure gaming and lauded by the international press, Sherlock Holmes is back with an investigation that is sure to be the most horrifying of the series. In this great new adventure, the famous detective chases against the most threatening serial killer England has ever known - Jack the Ripper.<br><br>						It’s 1888, London, in the Whitechapel area, and a series of grisly crimes in the heart of the East End leave a gory trail of mutilated female bodies. The police struggle to pick up the scent as the bodies pile up and paranoia sweeps the city. Sherlock Holmes immerses himself in the dark, sordid alleyways of Whitechapel in order to follow the trail of the one that the press calls Jack the Ripper. During a terrifying investigation, Holmes will attempt to lift the veil of mystery that shrouds the motives and the face behind that horrific nickname.<br><br>						Presented in full 3D, Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper offers players 2 different perspectives available at any moment in the game: a third-person view in the pure style of traditional point ’n’ click adventure games and a first-person view for close-up investigation.

Powerful new units under your command: Players can use or command combined arms teams — machine gun crews create intense fire, bazooka crews destroy buildings and tanks, and mortar crews pound the enemy from a distance.<br />
Play your own way: Players can choose to use their squad to execute a tactically elegant flanking maneuver or charge in with guns blazing.<br />
Destructible cover: Keep your men moving and choose your cover wisely — modeled using real physical properties and behaviors, weapons will damage, dent, scorch and destroy the world around you.<br />
Completely new multiplayer experience: Fight major multiplayer battles with dozens of players on each side, combining all the intensity and accessibility of Deathmatch with the squad-based gameplay that helped make Brothers In Arms famous.","Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway brings the critically acclaimed squad-based WWII shooter into the next generation of gaming with amazing graphics and sound, new cutting-edge gameplay features and a totally redesigned online component.",,"English, French, Italian, Spanish - Spain",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/15390/header.jpg?t=1544535852,http://www.brothersinarmsgame.com,"{'minimum': '<strong>Recommended:</strong>                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Supported OS: </strong>Windows XP SP3/Windows Vista SP1 (only)                        <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>2.6 GHz dual-core (3 GHz for Intel Pentium D 925)                        <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Memory: </strong>1 GB (2 GB Recommended)                         <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Graphics: </strong>128 MB DirectX 9.0c compliant, Shader 3.0–enabled (see supported list*)                          <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>DirectX Version: </strong>DirectX 9.0 or 10.0                          <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Sound: </strong>DirectX 9.0 or 10.0 compliant                           <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive: </strong> 8 GB free hard disk space                         <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Multiplay: </strong>Broadband internet connection with 384 Kbps upstream                        <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>*Supported Video Cards at Time of Release: </strong>  ATI RADEON X1600/1650–1950/HD 2000/3000 series,                    NVIDIA GeForce 6800/7/8/9 series.                        <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Laptop versions of these cards may work but are NOT supported.

As governor of a Roman province, you will devise a strategy to build a well organised, prosperous and commanding settlement. Its fortune very much lies in your own hands.                    <br>					Imperium Romanum features incredible attention to detail  and is packed with a variety of new, gameplay-enhancing features, such as a complete overhaul of the graphic engine and many of authentic historical buildings like the world-famous Circus Maximus or Gladiator schools.                    <br>					The Emperor Expansion pack takes you on a journey through ancient history, from cold Britannia and the wild forests of Germania to the fertile Nile Delta of Cleopatra's Egypt.                     <br>					19 challenging, new scenarios featuring historic places such as Aquae Sulis (Bath), Hadrian's Wall, Massilia or Treverorum will require all your comprehensive economic and strategic leadership abilities to succeed.

game,Lugaru HD,25010,0,False,,,"Follow Turner, a rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills in his quest to find those<br>					responsible for slaughtering his village. Uncover a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt<br>					leaders of the rabbit republic and the wolves of the nearby lands.<br><br>					<strong>Streamlined Combat:</strong> Gone are the days of combo memorization and button mashing.<br>					Lugaru uses a context-sensitive combat system to put all the moves at your finger tips. It’s<br>					up to you to choose the right move at the right time and think your way through the fights.<br><br>					<strong>Open-Ended Strategy:</strong> Each level presents you with an environment and a series of enemies.<br>					How you choose to defeat your adversaries is entirely up to you. Storm in from the front and<br>					fight everyone at once or ambush your foes one at a time with stealth attacks.<br><br>					<strong>Ragdoll Physics:</strong> Not only does striking your enemies do damage, but so does colliding with<br>					the environment once you’ve knocked them off their feet. Nothing does more damage than a<br>					swift rabbit kick that sends the enemy hurtling into a stone wall.<br><br>					<strong>Environmental Detail:</strong> Factors like wind direction and whether or not you remembered to clean<br>					the blood off your knife affect your ability to sneak up on the enemy undetected.<br>					Brutal AI: Enemies in Lugaru prefer unfair fights.

game,Order of War™,34600,0,False,,,"October 22, 2009 - Update <br>					<a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://Wargaming.net"" target=""_blank"" rel="" noopener""  >Wargaming.net</a> has released free Downloadable Content for Order of War. The DLC will download automatically the next time you launch the game. This DLC contains all the formerly exclusive pre-order items which include:<br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Heavy Bomber Squadrons</strong> - Addition of German Arado and Allied B-24 Marauder heavy bomber units to air support <br>					</li><li><strong>Infantry Mortar Launchers</strong> - Addition of infantry mortar units <br>					</li><li><strong>Off-Map Heavy Artillery</strong> - Addition of heavy artillery strikes to the air support menu <br>					</li><li><strong>Survival Mission Mode</strong> - New survival mission mode where you fend off waves of attacking enemies for as long as possible <br>					</li></ul> <br>					<h2 class=""bb_tag"">About Order of War</h2>					In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once. <br>				Their names were Overlord and Bagration.  Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory.  Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different. <br>				In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America's finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army's seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east.

You are a merchant in northern Europe in the late Middle Ages when the Hanseatic League was flourishing. Your goal is to rise to the most successful and influential member of the Hanse, ultimately being elected Elderman, leader of the trading league. You start bargaining with common goods, build up your own production and establish a merchant fleet. Later on, you will gain more and more political influence and even found new towns.<br>											<br>											However, a Hanse merchant's life can also have its dark sides. On your way to power you have to hold your ground against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with economic competition, price wars or impure means such as sabotage.
